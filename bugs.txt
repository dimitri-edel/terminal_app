A nasty bug found its way into my work today. The API started to deliver more hourly reports per day than the usual 24 hours.
This resulted in an index error in TextTable.addForecastColumns()-method, within the loop. The enty_index was getting out
of range. Took me over an hour of debugging and wrecking my mind to finally pin down the problem. I have no idea as to 
why the API started appending more hours, which technically belong in the dataset of the next day. However, I simply added
two lines of code in the loop, which check if the number of datasets exceed 24 (as in 24 hours), then these datasets will be
skipped.
