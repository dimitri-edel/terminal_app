## Migration to a different repository
I started working on the Project as sson as I learned the most basic things about Python. So I manually created a repository on GitHub
and started working locally on VS Code.
Later on, during my second session with my mentor he said that we were supposed to use a template, provided by code institute
and deploy the project on Heroku.
To cut the long story short, I exported the Project to a different repository, that was created using the template. Therefore, the first
batch of commits is missing in the currently used repository.
There were only four commits in total and the intial source code. Here is the link to the first repository if you find it relevant

## Size of the terminal
At first I adjusted the size of the terminal in the index.html that came with the template. It allowed me to have more space and create
larger tables, which could accomodate forecasts for up to seven days. Neither me, nor my mentor were sure about how the assemsment team
would feel about me changing the files, which Code Institute warned us agains changing. So, later on I changed it back to the intial width
of 80 columns.
