API sometimes delivers more datasets than expected
A nasty bug found its way into my work today. The API started to deliver more hourly reports per day than the usual 24 hours.
This resulted in an index error in TextTable.addForecastColumns()-method, within the loop. The enty_index was getting out
of range. Took me over an hour of debugging and wrecking my mind to finally pin down the problem. I have no idea as to 
why the API started appending more hours, which technically belong in the dataset of the next day. However, I simply added
two lines of code in the loop, which check if the number of datasets exceed 24 (as in 24 hours), then these datasets will be
skipped.

Can not get textwrapper.dedent() method to do what it is supposed to do
The textwraper.dedent() method is not doing what it's supposed to. After applying it the text still appears indented in the
TextTable. Found this on stackoverflow.com <code> print('\n'.join([m.lstrip() for m in message.split('\n')]))</code>.
I adjusted that to my code and it worked, the multi-line text appears without indentions.

An empty dataset appears in the forecast table 
The issue stemmed from a loop inside RequestInfo.__extract_forecast().
